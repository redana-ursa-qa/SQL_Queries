# SQL queries examples


Here I share examples of SQL queries that I use in testing practice.  
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to:
- work with relational databases;
- write clear and efficient SQL queries;
- data selection, filtering, aggregation, and joins.

For clarity, some queries are provided with screenshots of results.
